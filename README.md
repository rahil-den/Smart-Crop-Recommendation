# 🌾 Smart Crop Recommendation System

A machine learning powered web application that recommends the most suitable crop based on soil and climate parameters.  
This project uses Logistic Regression and a preprocessing pipeline for accurate predictions.

---

##  Features

- Predict the best crop based on:
  - Nitrogen (N)
  - Phosphorus (P)
  - Potassium (K)
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - Soil pH
  - Rainfall
- Fully functional Streamlit web app
- Logistic Regression model with sklearn pipeline
- Clean folder structure for production-ready ML deployment
- Dataset stored locally inside `/data`
